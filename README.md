# Keypoint-Learning

This sample demonstrates the use of a random forest, trained with the method proposed in [1], as a keypoints detector. Currently the code only demonstrates keypoint extraction from a pre-trained forest on the Mian and Stanford datasets. We are currently working also on adding the training code for learning a forest from a generic dataset.
