# Keypoint-Learning

Description
-----------
This framework demonstrates the use of a random forest, trained with the method proposed in [1], as a keypoints detector. 
The framework is composed by three different projects:
  * GenerateTrainingSet: implement the training set generation.
  * TrainDetector: starting from samples generated with GenerateTrainingSet, train a random forest for keypoints detection   (monoscale only).
 * TestDetector: demonstrates keypoints extraction (monoscale only).
